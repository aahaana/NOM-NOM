              <p>"Every one who’s ever tried feeding a baby knows how important it is to make the food look nice and funny – especially if it’s broccoli or porridge… This is because the looks of your food constitutes a great part of the overall pleasure of eating. But if you manage to turn your noodles into a unique artwork, or can make a plate of Angry bird sandwiches, or even stage an elaborate foodscape hardly anyone could say no to that!"
